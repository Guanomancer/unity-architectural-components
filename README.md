# Unity Architectural Components
Unity components for basic software architecture.

These are the basic architectural components that I use regularly. You are free to use them in your own projects under an MIT license.

I want these components to be fully tested, and thus I have only had time to add an event router and two statemachines.

For now, you'll have to look at the unit test code, to see examples of how to use these libraries, but I fully intend to document them and give both examples of how to use them codewise, and examples of WHY to use them architecturewise.
